1. Requirements
===================================

PHP v4.3 - 
  There are reports of the profiler working on PHP v5, but at the 
  time of writing, PHP v5 is not officially supported.

Apache 2.x -
  The profiler should be able to be installed with Apache 1, but 
  this configuration is not supported.

MySQL 4+ -
  
===================================
2. Downloading and Installing
===================================

-----------------------------------
2.1. Downloading
-----------------------------------

The latest release of the profiler can be downloaded from the Sourceforge project,
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpgwebprofiler/

Files downloaded should always be named rpgwebprofiler-x.x.x.tgz

If you want the development version, this can be downloaded from the Subversion repository
in the above project. 

-----------------------------------
2.2. Installing
-----------------------------------

Once you have the archive, create a directory for the profiler, and extract the archive into it.
Note, the directories that are created are accessed by Apache, so ensure the permission reflect
this. 

Note, this directory should NOT be directly shared by Apache. Rather, the public_profiler directory
should be accessed via an Alias directive. If you want to put the public directory directly into a 
web accessible folder, you should do the following:

- Copy root_profiler into a non-web accessible folder.
- Copy public_profiler into a web accessible folder.
- Edit the config.php file in public_profiler, and change the $ROOT_PATH variable to point
  to the location of your root_profiler directory.
- Rename public_profiler to something more friendly.

===================================
3. Create a MySQL Database
===================================

Create a MySQL database, refering to the MySQL documentation if you need assistance.

Once the database is created, import the root_profiler/setup-mysqldb.sql file into the database.

===================================
4. Configure RPG Web Profiler
===================================

In the root_profiler directory, copy the system-default.php file to system.php, as follows:

cp system-default.php system.php

By renaming the file in the archive, any upgrades that don't affect this config file should simply
be a matter of replacing files.

Open system.php in a text editor, and change the following variables as appropriate:

$BASE_INSTALL = The directory containing the root_profiler directory (eg - /home/username)
$WEB_INSTALL  = The location of the public_profiler directory (edit if moved).

$DB_HOST  = The address of the computer MySQL is installed on
$DB_USER  = Username to connect to the database with
$DB_PWD   = Password to connect to the database with
$DB       = The name of the database.

$URI_BASE = The browser address the profiler will be accessible at.
$URI_HOME = The homepage of your site. By default, this is the same as $URI_BASE

$URI_WEBMASTER = The URI the webmaster can be contacted at. This can be a web page or a mailto link.
$EMAIL_WEBMASTER = The webmasters email address

$URI_TOS  = Terms of service

$LOGO     = If you don't want to use the default profiler logo, this file can be changed.

===================================
5. Configure Apache
===================================

If you copied the public_profiler directory into an existing web-accessible folder, then
you should not need to do any additional Apache configuration.

If you didn't put the public_profiler directory into a web-accessible folder, you need to 
add an Alias to the Apache configuration file.

Eg.
----

Alias /profiler /home/username/rpgwebprofiler/public_profiler

<Directory "/home/username/rpgwebprofiler/public_profiler">
    AllowOverride All

    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
