v0.2.0 - 28 June 2006
===========================================

- Removed Smarty Templates
- New Admin Options
  - SITE_CSS: Change the CSS file in use to make updates easier
  - SITE_NEWS: Change the file used to display news.
  - NEW_WINDOW: Prevent Character sheets opening in a new window
  - REQUIRE_LOGIN: Remove public access to character sheets, so only registered users can see them
  - OPEN_REGISTRATION: Stop people from registering. Makes the site a private installation.
  - DISPLAY_IMAGES: Show/Hide the link to the character image library
  - DISPLAY_FAQ: Show/Hide the link to the FAQ
- Added imgs/blank.gif for use when no LOGO image is desired.

The first two admin options listed above, along with the previous renaming of
the system configuration file within the Subversion repository are intended to 
make future upgrade paths easier. Ideally, you should be able to extract a new
version of the application into the install directory without then having to
re-configure the application for your site.
