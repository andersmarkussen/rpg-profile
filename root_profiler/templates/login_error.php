  are listed below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You must be <a href="register.php">registered</a> before
    you can login.
  </li>
  <li>
    Login names and passphrases are case sensitive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only a profile name can be logged in. Individual character sheets do
    not have passwords and can not be used for login verification.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you can't remember your passphrase, request to have it
    <a href="resetpwd.php">reset</a>. Your profile must have
    a valid email address registered for this to work.
  </li>
</ul>
